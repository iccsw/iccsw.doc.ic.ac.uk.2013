## Laws of programming with concurrency
### Tony Hoare, Microsoft Research

The algebraic laws for programming with concurrency are as simple as 
(and very similar to) the familiar laws of arithmetic. Yet they are
stronger for reasoning about the properties of programs than the axioms
of Hoare Logic and the rules of an operational semantics put together.

_[Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/thoare/),
commonly known as Tony Hoare, is a British computer scientist, probably best known for the development in
1960, at age 26, of Quicksort. He also developed Hoare logic, the formal
language
[Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)](http://www.usingcsp.com/), and inspired the
[Occam programming language](http://pop-users.org/occam-pi/)._
