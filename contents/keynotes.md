## Laws of programming with concurrency
### Tony Hoare, Microsoft Research

The algebraic laws for programming with concurrency are as simple as 
(and very similar to) the familiar laws of arithmetic. Yet they are
stronger for reasoning about the properties of programs than the axioms
of Hoare Logic and the rules of an operational semantics put together.

_[Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/thoare/),
commonly known as Tony Hoare, is a British computer scientist, probably best known for the development in
1960, at age 26, of Quicksort. He also developed Hoare logic, the formal
language
[Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)](http://www.usingcsp.com/), and inspired the
[Occam programming language](http://pop-users.org/occam-pi/)._

## Building Better Online Courses
### Peter Norvig, Google

We now have many choices in designing a course, whether it is in the
classroom, online, or a hybrid. This talk will cover some of the
mechanics of running an online course, including the factors involved in
building a community. And we will discuss whether building a course is
like building software: in the early days, software was crafted by
individuals, but over time we established processes that enabled large
groups to build much larger systems.  Today, courses are still crafted
by an individual teacher -- if we want to build a larger class, serving
more students, and more potential paths through the material, do we need
a new set of course building processes? How can we assure that our
courses will continually improve in quality?
