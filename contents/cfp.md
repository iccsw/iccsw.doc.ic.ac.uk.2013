## 2013 Imperial College Computing Student Workshop

### 26-27 September, 2013, London, United Kingdom

The 3rd Imperial College Computing Student Workshop (ICCSW) aims to
provide an international forum for doctoral students in computing. While
most conferences and workshops in academia solely cater for specific
research areas, ICCSW encourages doctoral students from all disciplines
in computer science to submit papers and take part in the event. It is a
workshop organised by students for students. The workshop will be hosted
by the [Department of Computing](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at
[Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

The workshop offers:

* a traditional track featuring technical papers focused on current
topics in computer science
* a poster session
* a tools and demos session

### Important Dates

* Abstracts due: Monday, July 1, 2013, 11:59 p.m. BST
* Paper submission due: Monday, July 8, 2013, 11:59 p.m. BST
* Acceptance notification: Friday, August 2, 2013
* Final papers due: Friday, August 23, 2013, 11:59 p.m. BST

### Organisation

The local steering committee will consist of research students from the
department, who will be responsible for the organisation of the
workshop. Research students from outside Imperial College are invited to
become members of the organising committee as ambassadors of the
workshop in their respective university to promote and coordinate
students wishing to participate in the workshop.

### Submission

Preliminary size restrictions

* 8 pages for papers [OASIcs

* A1 size for posters

Details for submission methods will be announced in our website.
For each submitted papers, the authors will be required to review
approximately two or three papers, not necessarily related to the topic
of their immediate expertise. To ensure reviews are objective and
meet academic standards the steering commiteee will look at all reviews
prior to their release.

### Registration

Registration is free of charge for all students. Some student bursaries,
funded by industrial sponsors, will be made available to students with
submissions accepted in the workshop. We aim to provide financial
support for students who otherwise would be unable to attend.

The poster session provides an excellent opportunity to share and
discuss new ideas and interesting preliminary work. Poster presenters
will have the entirety of the evening reception to discuss their work,
get exposure and receive feedback from attendees. All students who have
a paper accepted for the workshop are welcome, but not required, to
submit the poster.
